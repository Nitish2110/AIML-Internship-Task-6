AI & ML Internship - Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

Objective
Implement and evaluate the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification using the Iris dataset.

Dataset Used
- Iris Dataset (loaded from sklearn.datasets)
- Multi-class classification (3 classes: setosa, versicolor, virginica)

Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Standardized features using StandardScaler.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Trained KNN models with different values of K (1 to 10).
5. Evaluated accuracy for each K value.
6. Chose best K and generated predictions.
7. Evaluated model using confusion matrix and classification report.
8. Visualized decision boundaries using the first two features.

Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Files Included
- Task6_KNN_Classification.ipynb (Colab notebook)
- README.md (this document)

Status
Task Completed and Submitted.
